* Any MySQL server supporting version 9 or 10 of the MySQL protocol

Because MySQL is not fully ANSI SQL-92 compliant, it is not possible to 
create a fully JDBC-compliant driver for MySQL.  However, this driver 
strives to implement as much of the JDBC API as is feasible.

INTRODUCTION

MySQL-JDBC is an implemntation of the JDBC API for the MySQL relational
database server. It strives to conform as much as possible to the API
as specified by JavaSoft. It is known to work with many third-party 
products, including Borland JBuilder, IBM Visual Age for Java, SQL/J,
the Locomotive and Symantec Visual Cafe.

USAGE AND INSTALLATION

MySQL-JDBC is distributed as a .jar archive containing the sources 
and class files as well as a class-file only "binary" .jar archive 
named "mysql-jdbc-2.0.15-bin.jar".

You will need to use the "jar" command-line utility that comes with your JDK 
to un-archive the distribution.

Once you have un-archived the distribution .jar archive,
you can install the driver in one of two ways:

Either copy the org subdirectory and all of it's contents
to anywhere you like, and put the directory holding the org subdirectory
in your classpath, or...

Put mysql-jdbc-2.0.15-bin.jar in your classpath, either by adding the 
FULL path to it to your CLASSPATH enviornment variable, or putting it
in $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext.

If you are using a servlet engine or application server, you will have
to read your vendor's documentation for more information on how to
configure third-party class libraries, as most application servers
ignore the CLASSPATH environment variable. If you are developing
servlets and/or JSPs, and your application server is J2EE-compliant, 
you should put the driver's .jar file in the WEB-INF/lib subdirectory
of your webapp, as this is the standard location for third party 
class libraries in J2EE web applications. You can also use the
MysqlDataSource, MysqlConnectionPoolDataSource or MysqlXADataSource 
classes in the com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional package, if your J2EE 
application server supports/requires them. MysqlDataSource supports the 
following parameters (through standard "set" mutators):

	user
	password
	serverName
	databaseName
	port

If you are going to use the driver with the JDBC DriverManager, you would use
"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" as the class that implements java.sql.Driver.

You might use this name in a Class.forName() call to load the driver:

	Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver").newInstance();

To connect to the database, you need to use a JDBC url with the following 
format ([xxx] denotes optional url components):

  jdbc:mysql://[hostname][:port]/[dbname][?param1=value1][&param2=value2].....

URL Parameters (can be passed as properties in 
DriverManager.getConnection() as well):

A simple connection example looks like:

	Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver").newInstance();
	
	java.sql.Connection conn;
	
	conn = DriverManager.getConnection(
		"jdbc:mysql://localhost/test?user=blah&password=blah");
	
If you need further JDBC tutorial information, please see
http://www.java.sun.com/products/jdbc/

The driver supports batch updates for Statements and PreparedStatements.
Batch updates will be processed in entirety, if any of the updates raise a
SQLException, a java.sql.BatchUpdateException will be thrown after all updates
have been processed, with update count values of '-3' for any statements that
were not completed (see section 6.1 in the JDBC-2.1 API spec for more details).

Various DataSource implementations exist, all under the 
com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional package. They are "MysqlDataSource",
"MysqlConnectionPoolDataSource" and "MysqlXaDataSource". Refer to your 
application server documentation for information on how to use these classes.
An example of using the standard DataSource ("MysqlDataSource") can be found
in the "testsuite" directory.

TROUBLESHOOTING

There are a few issues that seem to be encountered often by users of MySQL-JDBC. 
This section deals with their symptoms, and their resolutions. If you have
further issues, see the "SUPPORT" section below.

  Issue: 

  "When I try to connect to the database with MySQL-JDBC, I get the
  following exception:

  SQLException: Server configuration denies access to data source
  SQLState: 08001
  VendorError: 0

  What's going on? I can connect with the MySQL client."

  Resolution: 

  MySQL-JDBC must use TCP/IP sockets to connect to MySQL, as 
  Java does not support Unix Domain Sockets. Therefore, when MySQL-JDBC
  connects to MySQL, the security manager in MySQL server will use the
  HOSTS table to determine whether or not the connection should be allowed.

  You must add grants to allow this to happen. The following is an example
  of how to do this (but not the most secure).

  From the mysql command-line client, issue the following command

  "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON [dbname].* to '[user]'@'[hostname]' identified by 
  '[password]'"

  replacing [dbname] with the name of your database, [user] with the username,
  [hostname] with the host that MySQL-JDBC will be connecting from, and [password]
  with the password you want to use. Be aware that RedHat linux is broken with
  respect to the hostname portion for the case when you are connecting from 
  localhost. You need to use "localhost.localdomain" for the [hostname] value 
  in this case.

  Follow this by issuing the "FLUSH PRIVILEGES" command.

  I suggest you read the permissions/security section of your MySQL server 
  manual for a much more detailed explanation of how this works.
  
  ----

  Issue: 

  "My application throws a SQLException 'No Suitable Driver'".

  Resolution: 

  One of two things are happening. Either the driver is not in
  your CLASSPATH (see the "USAGE AND INSTALLATION" section above), or your
  URL format is incoorect (once again see "USAGE AND INSTALLATION").

  ----

  Issue: 

  "I'm trying to use MySQL-JDBC in an applet and I get the following
  exception: 
  
  SQLException: Cannot connect to MySQL server on host:3306. Is there 
  a MySQL server running on the machine/port you are trying to connect to? 
  (java.security.AccessControlException) 
  SQLState:     08S01 
  VendorError:  0 
  
  What's wrong?"

  Resolution:
  
  Applets can only make network connections back to the machine that the
  webserver that served the .class files for the applet. This means that
  mysql must run on the same machine (or you must have some sort of port
  re-direction) for this to work. This also means that you will not be
  able to test applets from your local filesystem, you must always deploy
  them to a webserver.

  ----

  Issue: 

  "I have a servlet/application that works fine for a day, and then stops 
  working overnight".

  Resolution: 

  MySQL closes connections after 8 hours of inactivity. You either
  need to use a connection pool that handles stale connections or use the 
  "autoReconnect" parameter (see "USAGE AND INSTALLATION"). Also, you should
  be catching SQLExceptions in your application and dealing with them, rather
  than propagating them all the way until your application exits, this is just
  good software development. MySQL-JDBC will set the SQLState (see 
  java.sql.SQLException.getSQLState() in your APIDOCS) to "08S01" when it 
  encounters network-connectivity issues during the processing of a query. 
  Your application code should then attempt to re-connect to MySQL at this 
  point.

  ----

  Issue:

  "I'm trying to use JDBC-2.0 updatable result sets, and I get an exception
  saying my result set is not updatable..."

  Resolution:

  Because MySQL does not have row identifiers, MySQL-JDBC can only update
  result sets that have come from queries that select the primary key(s) and
  only span one table (i.e. no joins). This is outlined in the JDBC specification.


KNOWN BUGS

There are some parts of the JDBC-2.0 spec that are not implemented (yet). 

If you see something that is not implemented, and you have an idea on how to
do it, go ahead and let me know. I'm always looking for help and/or feedback
about the driver.
