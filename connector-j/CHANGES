# Changelog
# $Id$

xx-xx-03 - Version 3.0.5-gamma
    - Fixed Buffer.fastSkipLenString() causing ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
      exceptions with some queries when unpacking fields.
      
01-06-03 - Version 3.0.4-gamma
	- Added quoted identifiers to database names for 
	  Connection.setCatalog.
	- Added support for quoted identifiers in PreparedStatement
	  parser.
	- Streamlined character conversion and byte[] handling in 
	  PreparedStatements for setByte().
	- Reduce memory footprint of PreparedStatements by sharing 
	  outbound packet with MysqlIO.
	- Added 'strictUpdates' property to allow control of amount
	  of checking for 'correctness' of updatable result sets. Set this
	  to 'false' if you want faster updatable result sets and you know
	  that you create them from SELECTs on tables with primary keys and
	  that you have selected all primary keys in your query.
	- Added support for 4.0.8-style large packets. 
	- Fixed PreparedStatement.executeBatch() parameter overwriting.
	  
12-17-02 - Version 3.0.3-dev
	- Changed charsToByte in SingleByteCharConverter to be non-static
	- Changed SingleByteCharConverter to use lazy initialization of each
	  converter.
	- Fixed charset handling in Fields.java
	- Implemented Connection.nativeSQL()
	- More robust escape tokenizer -- recognize '--' comments, and allow
	  nested escape sequences (see testsuite.EscapeProcessingTest)
	- DBMD.getImported/ExportedKeys() now handles multiple foreign keys 
	  per table.
	- Fixed ResultSetMetaData.getPrecision() returning incorrect values 
	  for some floating point types.
	- Fixed ResultSetMetaData.getColumnTypeName() returning BLOB for 
	  TEXT and TEXT for BLOB types.
	- Fixed Buffer.isLastDataPacket() for 4.1 and newer servers.
	- Added CLIENT_LONG_FLAG to be able to get more column flags 
	  (isAutoIncrement() being the most important)
	- Because of above, implemented ResultSetMetaData.isAutoIncrement()
	  to use Field.isAutoIncrement().
	- Honor 'lower_case_table_names' when enabled in the server when
	  doing table name comparisons in DatabaseMetaData methods.
	- Some MySQL-4.1 protocol support (extended field info from selects)
	- Use non-aliased table/column names and database names to fullly 
	  qualify tables and columns in UpdatableResultSet (requires 
	  MySQL-4.1 or newer)
	- Allow user to alter behavior of Statement/
	  PreparedStatement.executeBatch() via 'continueBatchOnError' property
	  (defaults to 'true').
	- Check for connection closed in more Connection methods 
	  (createStatement, prepareStatement, setTransactionIsolation,
	   setAutoCommit).
	- More robust implementation of updatable result sets. Checks that
	  _all_ primary keys of the table have been selected.
	- 'LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE ...' now works, if your server is configured
	  to allow it. Can be turned off with the 'allowLoadLocalInfile' 
	  property (see the README).
	- Substitute '?' for unknown character conversions in single-byte
	  character sets instead of '\0'.
	- NamedPipeSocketFactory now works (only intended for Windows), see
	  README for instructions.
	  
11-08-02 - Version 3.0.2-dev

	- Fixed issue with updatable result sets and PreparedStatements not 
	  working
	- Fixed ResultSet.setFetchDirection(FETCH_UNKNOWN)
	- Fixed issue when calling Statement.setFetchSize() when using 
	  arbitrary values
	- Fixed incorrect conversion in ResultSet.getLong()
	- Implemented ResultSet.updateBlob().
    - Removed duplicate code from UpdatableResultSet (it can be inherited 
      from ResultSet, the extra code for each method to handle updatability
      I thought might someday be necessary has not been needed).
    - Fixed "UnsupportedEncodingException" thrown when "forcing" a 
      character encoding via properties.
    - Fixed various non-ASCII character encoding issues.
    - Added driver property 'useHostsInPrivileges'. Defaults to true. 
      Affects whether or not '@hostname' will be used in 
      DBMD.getColumn/TablePrivileges.
    - All DBMD result set columns describing schemas now return NULL
      to be more compliant with the behavior of other JDBC drivers
      for other databases (MySQL does not support schemas).
    - Added SSL support. See README for information on how to use it.
    - Properly restore connection properties when autoReconnecting
      or failing-over, including autoCommit state, and isolation level.
    - Use 'SHOW CREATE TABLE' when possible for determining foreign key
      information for DatabaseMetaData...also allows cascade options for
      DELETE information to be returned
    - Escape 0x5c character in strings for the SJIS charset.
    - Fixed start position off-by-1 error in Clob.getSubString()
    - Implemented Clob.truncate()
    - Implemented Clob.setString()
    - Implemented Clob.setAsciiStream()
    - Implemented Clob.setCharacterStream()
    - Added com.mysql.jdbc.MiniAdmin class, which allows you to send
      'shutdown' command to MySQL server...Intended to be used when 'embedding'
      Java and MySQL server together in an end-user application.
    - Added 'connectTimeout' parameter that allows users of JDK-1.4 and newer
      to specify a maxium time to wait to establish a connection.
    - Failover and autoReconnect only work when the connection is in a 
      autoCommit(false) state, in order to stay transaction safe
    - Added 'queriesBeforeRetryMaster' property that specifies how many
      queries to issue when failed over before attempting to reconnect 
      to the master (defaults to 50)
    - Fixed DBMD.supportsResultSetConcurrency() so that it returns true
      for ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE and ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY or
      ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE
    - Fixed ResultSet.isLast() for empty result sets (should return false).
    - PreparedStatement now honors stream lengths in setBinary/Ascii/Character
      Stream() unless you set the connection property 
      'useStreamLengthsInPrepStmts' to 'false'.
    - Removed some not-needed temporary object creation by using Strings
      smarter in EscapeProcessor, Connection and DatabaseMetaData classes.
             	
09-21-02 - Version 3.0.1-dev
	
    - Fixed ResultSet.getRow() off-by-one bug.
    - Fixed RowDataStatic.getAt() off-by-one bug.
    - Added limited Clob functionality (ResultSet.getClob(),
      PreparedStatemtent.setClob(), 
      PreparedStatement.setObject(Clob).
    - Added socketTimeout parameter to URL.
    - Connection.isClosed() no longer "pings" the server.
    - Connection.close() issues rollback() when getAutoCommit() == false
    - Added "paranoid" parameter...sanitizes error messages removing
      "sensitive" information from them (i.e. hostnames, ports,
      usernames, etc.), as well as clearing "sensitive" data structures
      when possible.
    - Fixed ResultSetMetaData.isSigned() for TINYINT and BIGINT.
    - Charsets now automatically detected. Optimized code for single-byte
      character set conversion.
    - Implemented ResultSet.getCharacterStream()
    - Added "LOCAL TEMPORARY" to table types in DatabaseMetaData.getTableTypes()
    - Massive code clean-up to follow Java coding conventions (the time had come)

04-07-02 - Version 2.0.12

	- General code cleanup. 
	- Added getIdleFor() method to Connection and 
	  MysqlLogicalHandle.

	  that need them (should fix 518108)
	- Added support for YEAR type (533556)
	- ResultSet.insertRow() should now detect auto_increment fields
	  in most cases and use that value in the new row. This detection
	  will not work in multi-valued keys, however, due to the fact that
	  the MySQL protocol does not return this information.
	- ResultSet.refreshRow() implemented.
	- Fixed testsuite.Traversal afterLast() bug, thanks to Igor Lastric.
	
01-27-02 - Version 2.0.11

	 - Fixed missing DELETE_RULE value in 
	   DBMD.getImported/ExportedKeys() and getCrossReference().
	 - Full synchronization of Statement.java.
	 - More changes to fix "Unexpected end of input stream"
	   errors when reading BLOBs. This should be the last fix.
	   
01-24-02 - Version 2.0.10

     - Fixed spurious "Unexpected end of input stream" errors in 
       MysqlIO (bug 507456).

	 - Ant build was corrupting included jar files, fixed 
	   (bug 487669).
	 - Fixed extra memory allocation in MysqlIO.readPacket() 
	   (bug 488663).
     - Implementation of DatabaseMetaData.getExported/ImportedKeys() and
       getCrossReference().
     - Full synchronization on methods modifying instance and class-shared
       references, driver should be entirely thread-safe now (please
       let me know if you have problems)
     - DataSource implementations moved to org.gjt.mm.mysql.jdbc2.optional
       package, and (initial) implementations of PooledConnectionDataSource
       and XADataSource are in place (thanks to Todd Wolff for the 
       implementation and testing of PooledConnectionDataSource with 
       IBM WebSphere 4).
     - Added detection of network connection being closed when reading packets
       (thanks to Todd Lizambri).
     - Fixed quoting error with escape processor (bug 486265).
     - Report batch update support through DatabaseMetaData (bug 495101).
     - Fixed off-by-one-hour error in PreparedStatement.setTimestamp() 
       (bug 491577).
     - Removed concatenation support from driver (the '||' operator),
       as older versions of VisualAge seem to be the only thing that
       use it, and it conflicts with the logical '||' operator. You will
       need to start mysqld with the "--ansi" flag to use the '||' 
       operator as concatenation (bug 491680)
     - Fixed casting bug in PreparedStatement (bug 488663).

	 - Batch updates now supported (thanks to some inspiration 
	   from Daniel Rall).
	 - XADataSource/ConnectionPoolDataSource code (experimental)
	 - PreparedStatement.setAnyNumericType() now handles positive
	   exponents correctly (adds "+" so MySQL can understand it).
	 - DatabaseMetaData.getPrimaryKeys() and getBestRowIdentifier()
	   are now more robust in identifying primary keys (matches 
	   regardless of case or abbreviation/full spelling of Primary Key
	   in Key_type column).
	   
10-24-01 - Version 2.0.7

         - PreparedStatement.setCharacterStream() now implemented
         
	 - Fixed dangling socket problem when in high availability
	   (autoReconnect=true) mode, and finalizer for Connection will
	   close any dangling sockets on GC.
	   
         - Fixed ResultSetMetaData.getPrecision() returning one
           less than actual on newer versions of MySQL.
           
         - ResultSet.getBlob() now returns null if column value
           was null.
           
         - Character sets read from database if useUnicode=true
           and characterEncoding is not set. (thanks to 
           Dmitry Vereshchagin)
           
         - Initial transaction isolation level read from 
           database (if avaialable) (thanks to Dmitry Vereshchagin)
           
         - Fixed DatabaseMetaData.supportsTransactions(), and
           supportsTransactionIsolationLevel() and getTypeInfo()
           SQL_DATETIME_SUB and SQL_DATA_TYPE fields not being
           readable.
            
         - Fixed PreparedStatement generating SQL that would end
           up with syntax errors for some queries.
           
         - Fixed ResultSet.isAfterLast() always returning false.
         
         - Fixed timezone issue in PreparedStatement.setTimestamp()
           (thanks to Erik Olofsson)
         
         - Captialize type names when "captializeTypeNames=true"
           is passed in URL or properties (for WebObjects, thanks
           to Anjo Krank)
         
         - Updatable result sets now correctly handle NULL
           values in fields.
           
         - PreparedStatement.setDouble() now uses full-precision
           doubles (reverting a fix made earlier to truncate them).
           
         - PreparedStatement.setBoolean() will use 1/0 for values
           if your MySQL Version >= 3.21.23.

06-16-01 - Fixed PreparedStatement parameter checking
	 
	 - Fixed case-sensitive column names in ResultSet.java

         - ResultSet.getBoolean() now recognizes '-1' as 'true'

         - ResultSet has +/-Inf/inf support

         - ResultSet.insertRow() works now, even if not all columns are
           set (they will be set to "NULL")

         - DataBaseMetaData.getCrossReference() no longer ArrayIndexOOB

         - getObject() on ResultSet correctly does TINYINT->Byte and
           SMALLINT->Short

12-03-00 - Implemented getBigDecimal() without scale component
           for JDBC2.

         - Fixed composite key problem with updateable result sets.

         - Added detection of -/+INF for doubles.

         - Faster ASCII string operations.

         - Fixed incorrect detection of MAX_ALLOWED_PACKET, so sending

	 - Columns that are of type TEXT now return as Strings
           when you use getObject()

	 - DatabaseMetaData.getPrimaryKeys() now works correctly wrt
	   to key_seq. Thanks to Brian Slesinsky.

         - No escape processing is done on PreparedStatements anymore
           per JDBC spec.

         - Fixed many JDBC-2.0 traversal, positioning bugs, especially
           wrt to empty result sets. Thanks to Ron Smits, Nick Brook,
           Cessar Garcia and Carlos Martinez.

	 - Fixed some issues with updatability support in ResultSet when
           using multiple primary keys.

02-21-00 - Fixed Bad Handshake problem.

01-10-00 - Fixes to ResultSet for insertRow() - Thanks to
           Cesar Garcia

	 - Fix to Driver to recognize JDBC-2.0 by loading a JDBC-2.0
           class, instead of relying on JDK version numbers. Thanks
	   to John Baker.

	 - Fixed ResultSet to return correct row numbers.

	 - Statement.getUpdateCount() now returns rows matched,
	   instead of rows actually updated, which is more SQL-92
	   like.

10-29-99 - Statement/PreparedStatement.getMoreResults() bug fixed. 
           Thanks to Noel J. Bergman.

         - Added Short as a type to PreparedStatement.setObject().
           Thanks to Jeff Crowder

         - Driver now automagically configures maximum/preferred packet
           sizes by querying server.

         - Autoreconnect code uses fast ping command if server supports
           it.

         - Fixed various bugs wrt. to packet sizing when reading from
           the server and when alloc'ing to write to the server.

08-17-99 - Now compiles under JDK-1.2. The driver supports both JDK-1.1
           and JDK-1.2 at the same time through a core set of classes.
           The driver will load the appropriate interface classes at
           runtime by figuring out which JVM version you are using.

         - Fixes for result sets with all nulls in the first row.
           (Pointed out by Tim Endres)

         - Fixes to column numbers in SQLExceptions in ResultSet
           (Thanks to Blas Rodriguez Somoza)

         - The database no longer needs to specified to connect.
           (Thanks to Christian Motschke)

07-04-99 - Better Documentation (in progress), in doc/mm.doc/book1.html

           DBMD now allows null for a column name pattern (not in 
           spec), which it changes to '%'.

           DBMD now has correct types/lengths for getXXX().

           ResultSet.getDate(), getTime(), and getTimestamp() fixes. 
           (contributed by Alan Wilken)

           EscapeProcessor now handles \{ \} and { or } inside quotes
           correctly. (thanks to Alik for some ideas on how to fix it)

           Fixes to properties handling in Connection.
           (contributed by Juho Tikkala)

           ResultSet.getObject() now returns null for NULL columns
           in the table, rather than bombing out.
           (thanks to Ben Grosman)

           ResultSet.getObject() now returns Strings for types
           from MySQL that it doesn't know about. (Suggested by
           Chris Perdue)

           Removed DataInput/Output streams, not needed, 1/2 number
           of method calls per IO operation.

           Use default character encoding if one is not specified. This
           is a work-around for broken JVMs, because according to spec,
           EVERY JVM must support "ISO8859_1", but they don't.

06-03-99 - Fixed Connection to use the platform character encoding
           instead of "ISO8859_1" if one isn't explicitly set. This 
           fixes problems people were having loading the character-
           converter classes that didn't always exist (JVM bug).
           (thanks to Fritz Elfert for pointing out this problem)

05-27-99 - Changed MysqlIO to re-use packets where possible to reduce
           memory usage.

05-13-99 - Fixed escape-processor bugs pertaining to {} inside
           quotes.

04-14-99 - Fixed character-set support for non-Javasoft JVMs
           (thanks to many people for pointing it out)

           Fixed ResultSet.getBoolean() to recognize 'y' & 'n'
           as well as '1' & '0' as boolean flags.
           (thanks to Tim Pizey)

           Fixed ResultSet.getTimestamp() to give better performance.
           (thanks to Richard Swift)

           Fixed getByte() for numeric types.
           (thanks to Ray Bellis)

           Fixed DatabaseMetaData.getTypeInfo() for DATE type.
           (thanks to Paul Johnston)

           Fixed EscapeProcessor for "fn" calls.
	   (thanks to Piyush Shah at locomotive.org)

           Fixed EscapeProcessor to not do extraneous work if there
           are no escape codes.
           (thanks to Ryan Gustafson)

           Fixed Driver to parse URLs of the form "jdbc:mysql://host:port"
           (thanks to Richard Lobb)

03-24-99 - Fixed Timestamps for PreparedStatements
    
           Fixed null pointer exceptions in RSMD and RS

           Re-compiled with jikes for valid class files (thanks ms!)

03-08-99 - Fixed escape processor to deal with un-matched { and }
           (thanks to Craig Coles)
           
           Fixed escape processor to create more portable (between
           DATETIME and TIMESTAMP types) representations so that
           it will work with BETWEEN clauses.
           (thanks to Craig Longman)
           
           MysqlIO.quit() now closes the socket connection. Before,
           after many failed connections some OS's would run out
           of file descriptors. (thanks to Michael Brinkman)
           
           Fixed NullPointerException in Driver.getPropertyInfo.
           (thanks to Dave Potts)
            
           Fixes to MysqlDefs to allow all *text fields to be
           retrieved as Strings.
           (thanks to Chris at Leverage)
           
           Fixed setDouble in PreparedStatement for large numbers
           to avoid sending scientific notation to the database.
           (thanks to J.S. Ferguson)
           
           Fixed getScale() and getPrecision() in RSMD.
           (contrib'd by James Klicman)
           
           Fixed getObject() when field was DECIMAL or NUMERIC
           (thanks to Bert Hobbs)
           
           DBMD.getTables() bombed when passed a null table-name
           pattern. Fixed. (thanks to Richard Lobb)
           
           Added check for "client not authorized" errors during
           connect. (thanks to Hannes Wallnoefer)
           
02-19-99 - Result set rows are now byte arrays. Blobs and Unicode
           work bidriectonally now. The useUnicode and encoding
           options are implemented now.
           
           Fixes to PreparedStatement to send binary set by
           setXXXStream to be sent un-touched to the MySQL server.
           
           Fixes to getDriverPropertyInfo().
           
12-31-98 - Changed all ResultSet fields to Strings, this should allow
           Unicode to work, but your JVM must be able to convert
           between the character sets. This should also make reading
           data from the server be a bit quicker, because there is now
           no conversion from StringBuffer to String.

           Changed PreparedStatement.streamToString() to be more
           efficient (code from Uwe Schaefer).

	     URL parsing is more robust (throws SQL exceptions on errors
           rather than NullPointerExceptions)

           PreparedStatement now can convert Strings to Time/Date values
           via setObject() (code from Robert Currey).

	     IO no longer hangs in Buffer.readInt(), that bug was
           introduced in 1.1d when changing to all byte-arrays for
           result sets. (Pointed out by Samo Login)

11-03-98 - Fixes to DatabaseMetaData to allow both IBM VA and J-Builder
           to work. Let me know how it goes. (thanks to Jac Kersing)

	     Fix to ResultSet.getBoolean() for NULL strings 
	     (thanks to Barry Lagerweij)

	     Beginning of code cleanup, and formatting. Getting ready
	     to branch this off to a parallel JDBC-2.0 source tree.

           Added "final" modifier to critical sections in MysqlIO and
           Buffer to allow compiler to inline methods for speed.

9-29-98 - If object references passed to setXXX() in PreparedStatement are
          null, setNull() is automatically called for you. (Thanks for the
          suggestion goes to Erik Ostrom)

          setObject() in PreparedStatement will now attempt to write a 
          serialized  representation of the object to the database for
          objects of Types.OTHER and objects of unknown type.

          Util now has a static method readObject() which given a ResultSet
          and a column index will re-instantiate an object serialized in
          the above manner.

9-02-98 - Got rid of "ugly hack" in MysqlIO.nextRow(). Rather than
          catch an exception, Buffer.isLastDataPacket() was fixed.
          
          Connection.getCatalog() and Connection.setCatalog()
          should work now.

          Statement.setMaxRows() works, as well as setting
          by property maxRows. Statement.setMaxRows() overrides
          maxRows set via properties or url parameters.

	  Automatic re-connection is available. Because it has
          to "ping" the database before each query, it is
          turned off by default. To use it, pass in "autoReconnect=true"
          in the connection URL. You may also change the number of
          reconnect tries, and the initial timeout value via 
          "maxReconnects=n" (default 3) and "initialTimeout=n" 
          (seconds, default 2) parameters. The timeout is an 
          exponential backoff type of timeout, e.g. if you have initial 
          timeout of 2 seconds, and maxReconnects of 3, then the driver
          will timeout 2 seconds, 4 seconds, then 16 seconds between each
          re-connection attempt.

8-24-98 - Fixed handling of blob data in Buffer.java
	
	  Fixed bug with authentication packet being
	  sized too small.

	  The JDBC Driver is now under the LPGL to allow 
          people to legally include it in their non-GPL'd 
          software.
	
8-14-98 - Fixed Buffer.readLenString() to correctly
          read data for BLOBS.
          
          Fixed PreparedStatement.stringToStream to
          correctly read data for BLOBS.
          
          Fixed PreparedStatement.setDate() to not
          add a day.
          
          (above fixes thanks to Vincent Partington)
          
          Added URL parameter parsing (?user=... etc).
          
          (thanks to Sander Magi).

8-04-98 - Big news! New package name. Tim Endres from ICE
          Engineering is starting a new source tree for
          GNU GPL'd Java software. He's graciously given
          me the org.gjt.mm package directory to use, so now 
          the driver is in the org.gjt.mm.mysql package scheme.
          I'm "legal" now. Look for more information on Tim's
          project soon.
          
          Now using dynamically sized packets to reduce
          memory usage when sending commands to the DB.
          
          Small fixes to getTypeInfo() for parameters, etc.
          
          DatabaseMetaData is now fully implemented. Let me
          know if these drivers work with the various IDEs
          out there. I've heard that they're working with
          JBuilder right now.
          
          Added JavaDoc documentation to the package.
          
          Package now available in .zip or .tar.gz.
          
7-29-98 - Implemented getTypeInfo(). 
          Connection.rollback() now throws an SQLException
          per the JDBC spec.

7-28-98 - Added PreparedStatement that supports all JDBC API
          methods for PreparedStatement including InputStreams.
          Please check this out and let me know if anything is
          broken.
          
          Fixed a bug in ResultSet that would break some
          queries that only returned 1 row.
          
          Fixed bugs in DatabaseMetaData.getTables(), 
          DatabaseMetaData.getColumns() and
          DatabaseMetaData.getCatalogs().
          
          Added functionality to Statement that allows
          executeUpdate() to store values for IDs that are
          automatically generated for AUTO_INCREMENT fields.
          Basically, after an executeUpdate(), look at the
          SQLWarnings for warnings like "LAST_INSERTED_ID =
          'some number', COMMAND = 'your SQL query'".
          
          If you are using AUTO_INCREMENT fields in your
          tables and are executing a lot of executeUpdate()s
          on one Statement, be sure to clearWarnings() every
          so often to save memory.

7-06-98 - Split MysqlIO and Buffer to separate classes. Some
          ClassLoaders gave an IllegalAccess error for some
          fields in those two classes. Now mm.mysql works in 
          applets and all classloaders.

          Thanks to Joe Ennis <jce@mail.boone.com> for pointing
          out the problem and working on a fix with me.

7-01-98 - Fixed DatabaseMetadata problems in getColumns() and
          bug in switch statement in the Field constructor.

          Thanks to Costin Manolache <costin@tdiinc.com> for 
          pointing these out.

5-21-98 - Incorporated efficiency changes from 
          Richard Swift <Richard.Swift@kanatek.ca> in
          MysqlIO.java and ResultSet.java

          We're now 15% faster than gwe's driver.

          Started working on DatabaseMetaData.
          
          The following methods are implemented:
           * getTables() 
           * getTableTypes()
           * getColumns
           * getCatalogs()
