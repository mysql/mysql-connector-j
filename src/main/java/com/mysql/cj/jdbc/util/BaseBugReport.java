/**
 * Base class to help file bug reports for Connector/J.
 * 
 * <p>
 * MySQL AB, 2008 Sun Microsystems, 2009 Oracle Corporation
 * 
 * <ul>
 * really
 * </ul>
 * appreciates repeatable testcases when reporting bugs, so we're giving you this class to make that job a bit easier (and standarized).
 * 
 * <p>
 * To create a testcase, create a class that inherits from this class (com.mysql.cj.jdbc.util.BaseBugReport), and override the methods 'setUp', 'tearDown' and
 * 'runTest'.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In the 'setUp' method, create code that creates your tables, and populates them with any data needed to demonstrate the bug.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In the 'runTest' method, create code that demonstrates the bug using the tables and data you created in the 'setUp' method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In the 'tearDown' method, drop any tables you created in the 'setUp' method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In any of the above three methods, you should use one of the variants of the 'getConnection' method to create a JDBC connection to MySQL, which will use the
 * default JDBC URL of 'jdbc:mysql:///test'.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you need to use a JDBC URL that is different than 'jdbc:mysql:///test', then override the method 'getUrl' as well.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Use the 'assertTrue' methods to create conditions that must be met in your testcase demonstrating the behavior you are expecting (vs. the behavior you are
 * observing, which is why you are most likely filing a bug report).
 * 
 * <p>
 * Finally, create a 'main' method that creates a new instance of your testcase, and calls the 'run' method:
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
 *     new MyBugReport().run();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * When filing a potential bug with MySQL Connector/J at http://bugs.mysql.com/ or on the bugs mailing list, please include the code that you have just written
 * using this class.
